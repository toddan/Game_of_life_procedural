           This is a simple game of life implementation        
           written in a procedural way. this is not            
           meant to be a perfect implementation but            
           more of a beginner first starters version.          
           I tried to write it in a way that dose not aim      
           to be "clever" but to be easy to                    
           read and understand                                 
           for a beginner programmer.                          
                                                               
           The code dose not follow any standard C# code       
           style.
